# UVM138 tests whose Questa gold VCD is effectively "smoke-only".
#
# These tests were made VCD-diffable by the bound helper
# `tests/support/svtests_uvm_vcd_smoke.sv`, but they do not have meaningful
# DUT/module signals under `top` to compare waveforms against.
#
# Use this list with outcome-based checks (e.g. UVM M0 / :assert:), not waveform
# parity.
#
# This list is the set difference:
